# Trip Planner (Front End)

## What is this?
This is a webapp where users can plan a trip in a group collaboratively. Users can add events to a trip. Users can also suggest an event where members of the trip can vote on whether or not to add it to the trip. Users can also suggest an alternative to an already existing event.
